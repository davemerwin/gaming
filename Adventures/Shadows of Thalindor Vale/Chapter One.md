Chapter One: Shadows in the Alehouse

Adventure Start: Arrival in Avery

Read-Aloud Text:

	The town of Avery lies at the edge of the forest, where stone and timber blend together in uneasy harmony. Dwarven craftsmanship rises in sturdy walls and sturdy gates, while the forestfolk’s influence shows in the vine-wrapped beams and wooden carvings. The scars of the Dark War linger—shattered statues and blackened stones serve as grim reminders of what was lost.

As the adventurers approach, they notice the tension among the townsfolk: nervous glances, hurried steps, and the presence of guards at nearly every corner.

Exploring Avery

Before the raid begins, the adventurers can explore the town and learn more about the current state of the Vale.
	1.	The Veiled Tankard (Tavern):
	•	The party is introduced to Thurgren Stonefist, the weary dwarven guard captain. He shares his frustration about the wolves and crows, who’ve been raiding the town’s outskirts.
	•	Kaelthara, a foxfolk elder, warns the party about escalating violence and tensions between dwarves and forestfolk.
	•	NPCs at the tavern gossip about strange sightings in the forest and rumors of the wolves’ shapeshifting abilities.
	2.	The Town Gate:
	•	The adventurers can speak with the guards, who are on edge from recent attacks. A Perception Check (DC 13) reveals claw marks on the gate and evidence of a recent skirmish.
	3.	Marketplace:
	•	Merchants sell basic supplies but complain about disrupted trade routes. A Persuasion Check (DC 15) might reveal rumors about the wolves and crows targeting caravans.

The Raid: Attack on the Veiled Tankard

As the adventurers settle into the Veiled Tankard for the evening, the raid begins.

Read-Aloud Text:

	The laughter and chatter of the tavern are suddenly drowned out by a distant howl, sharp and haunting. The room falls silent as the howl is joined by another, then another. A heavy thud shakes the tavern door, followed by the splintering of wood as a pack of wolves bursts inside, their eyes gleaming with unnatural intelligence. From the broken windows, the screeches of crows pierce the air, and black wings descend.

Combat Encounter: Tavern Defense
	•	Enemies:
	•	Wolves (5): 
		•	HP: 16 | 22  | 22 each | AC: 13
		•	Pack tactics and knockdown abilities.
	•	Crows (10): 
		•	HP: 15 each | AC: 12
		•	Agile fliers that harass from above.
	•	Crow Shapeshifter Lieutenant (1): 
		•	HP: 57 | AC: 16
		•	A humanoid crow wielding spells like Entangle and Thunderwave, leading the attack.
		•	Additional Abilities: Can cast Call Lightning (a 3rd-level spell that summons a storm cloud and strikes targets within a 120-foot range with lightning bolts, dealing 3d10 lightning damage; it is cast by invoking the power of the storm with a verbal and somatic component) and has a flight speed of 60 feet.
	•	Tactics:
	•	The wolves focus on flanking and overwhelming single targets, while the crows use hit-and-run tactics to disrupt spellcasters and ranged fighters.
	•	The shapeshifter uses magic to control the battlefield and targets key NPCs in the tavern.

Dynamic Elements:
	•	Panicked Civilians: Protecting patrons (3-5 civilians) is optional but earns goodwill.
	•	Fire Hazard: A spilled lantern sets part of the tavern ablaze, creating a spreading hazard that forces the adventurers to reposition.
	•	Collapsing Furniture: Wolves knock over tables and benches, creating difficult terrain.

Aftermath of the Raid

The wolves and crows retreat after a few losses, leaving the tavern damaged and its patrons shaken.

Key Outcomes:
	1.	Clues Left Behind:
	•	A wolf’s corpse bears a crude collar marked with a strange symbol resembling roots entwined around a claw. A successful Arcana or Nature Check (DC 14) reveals this symbol represents primal druidic magic, twisted for domination.
	•	A captured crow (if subdued) cackles, “We’ll take the Vale by tooth and claw! Your walls won’t save you!”
	2.	Thurgren’s Plea:
Captain Thurgren, bloodied but resolute, addresses the adventurers:
	“We can’t take another attack like this. We’re stretched thin as it is. If you’ve got steel in your spine, head east and cut the head off this beast before it’s too late. I’ll make it worth your while.”

He offers 500 gold pieces and a choice of heirloom items:
	•	Thurgren’s Warhammer (+1 Weapon)
	•	Cloak of Protection
	•	Potion of Superior Healing
	3.	Kaelthara’s Warning:
The foxfolk elder cautions the adventurers against provoking the wolves and crows further.
	“They’re dangerous, yes, but not mindless. If you understand their motives, you might stop this war before it consumes us all.”

Next Steps: Into the Forest

With the town in shambles, the adventurers set off into the eastern forest, following the wolves and crows’ trail. A Survival Check (DC 15) reveals clawed tracks and broken branches leading deeper into the woods.

Foreshadowing:
	•	The trail ends at the banks of a wide river, where a ruined stone bridge looms in the distance.

Transition to Chapter Two:
The adventurers arrive at the bridge, the only crossing into the heart of the wolves and crows’ territory, setting the stage for their next challenge.
