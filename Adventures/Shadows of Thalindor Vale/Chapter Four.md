Chapter Four: The Siege of the Dwarven Kingdom

Overview

The wolves and crows have launched their boldest assault yet on Karak Rhun, the ancient dwarven stronghold. Their leader seeks to claim the Forge of Kings, a powerful artifact within the mountain, to craft enchanted weapons capable of subjugating the Vale. The adventurers, guided by the Fox Lord, must infiltrate the besieged kingdom through a secret path, navigate its labyrinthine halls, and confront the wolves and crows‚Äô leaders in a climactic battle to save both the dwarves and the forest.

This chapter blends infiltration, exploration, and an epic final confrontation with high-stakes consequences for the Vale.

The Journey to Karak Rhun

The adventurers travel with the Fox Lord to the hidden entrance into Karak Rhun, bypassing the main battlefield.

Read-Aloud Text:

	The path to Karak Rhun winds through jagged cliffs and rocky outcroppings, the air thick with smoke and the distant sound of clashing steel. As you approach the mountain‚Äôs shadow, the Fox Lord halts, his keen eyes scanning the terrain. ‚ÄúHere,‚Äù he says, motioning to an overgrown crevice. ‚ÄúThis path was known to few even in the Dark War. Follow me‚Äîand step lightly.‚Äù

Infiltrating Karak Rhun

The secret entrance is a narrow, root-choked tunnel that winds into the mountain‚Äôs lower levels.
	1.	Obstacles in the Secret Path:
	‚Ä¢	Collapsed Sections: Portions of the tunnel require climbing or squeezing through tight gaps (Athletics or Acrobatics Check, DC 13).
	‚Ä¢	Dormant Traps: Forgotten dwarven defenses, such as pressure plates triggering dart traps or collapsing walls, require Investigation Checks (DC 14) to detect.
	2.	Optional Encounters:
	‚Ä¢	Scouting Patrol: A small group of wolves has discovered the tunnel and blocks the path.
	‚Ä¢	Restless Spirits: The tunnel, untouched since the Dark War, is haunted by faint echoes of dwarven warriors who fell here. Arcana or Religion Checks (DC 15) can calm the spirits.

Inside Karak Rhun

The adventurers emerge into the lower halls of the dwarven stronghold, where the air is heavy with dust and the echoes of battle. The wolves and crows have breached the outer defenses, pushing the dwarves deeper into the mountain.

Key Areas in the Stronghold

	1.	The Hall of Ancestors:
	‚Ä¢	A grand chamber filled with statues of dwarven heroes, now scarred by battle. Wolves and crows prowl among the rubble.
	‚Ä¢	Combat Option: A pack of wolves (2) and a crow scout (1) patrol the hall.
	‚Ä¢	Puzzle Option: One statue holds a lever that opens a secret passage to bypass the enemy patrol. A Perception or Investigation Check (DC 14) reveals its location.
	2.	The Foundry Quarter:
	‚Ä¢	This industrial area, where the dwarves once smelted ore, has become a battlefield. The wolves have overrun the forges, and the air is thick with smoke and heat.
	‚Ä¢	Environmental Hazards:
	‚Ä¢	Molten metal flows across the floor, requiring Dexterity Saves (DC 13) to avoid.
	‚Ä¢	Crumbling machinery can be used against enemies or traps adventurers if mishandled.
	‚Ä¢	Allied Dwarves: A small group of dwarven smiths holds the line. Helping them can secure valuable allies for the final battle.
	3.	The Grand Staircase:
	‚Ä¢	The final approach to the Forge of Kings, the staircase is a chokepoint filled with wolves and crows guarding their leader‚Äôs ascent.
	‚Ä¢	Combat Encounter:
	‚Ä¢	Wolf Pack (4): Use the narrow staircase to block progress and isolate adventurers.
	‚Ä¢	Crow Shapeshifter Lieutenant (1): Casts spells like Entangle and Thunderwave to disrupt the party.
	‚Ä¢	Alternative Option: The adventurers can scale the outer walls of the staircase (Athletics Check, DC 15) to flank the guards.

The Forge of Kings: Final Confrontation

Read-Aloud Text:

	The Forge of Kings is a massive cavern filled with dwarven ingenuity and ancient power. Molten metal flows through carved channels, casting flickering orange light across towering forges and massive anvils. At the center of the forge stands a glowing pedestal, where an ancient hammer rests‚Äîa relic of the mountain‚Äôs might. Before it stands the crow leader, their dark wings spread wide, chanting as the wolf lieutenant growls at their side. ‚ÄúWith this forge,‚Äù the crow hisses, ‚Äúthe Vale will kneel!‚Äù

The Battlefield:
	1.	Hazards:
	‚Ä¢	Molten Metal Channels: Falling into a channel deals 5d10 fire damage and requires a Strength Check (DC 14) to escape.
	‚Ä¢	Falling Machinery: Unstable forges collapse at random, forcing creatures to make Dexterity Saves (DC 14) or take 2d10 bludgeoning damage.
	2.	Environmental Options:
	‚Ä¢	Adventurers can use forge tools (e.g., swinging chains or molten slag) to damage enemies or block paths.
	‚Ä¢	The dwarves‚Äô ballista, if repaired, provides a powerful ranged attack (4d10 piercing damage).

Final Combat Encounter:
	1.	Crow Commander (Leader):
	‚Ä¢	HP: 120 | AC: 15
	‚Ä¢	Spellcasting:
	‚Ä¢	Entangle, Gust of Wind, Call Lightning.
	‚Ä¢	Shapeshifting: Can switch between humanoid and crow forms, gaining flight in the latter.
	‚Ä¢	Aura of Command: Allies within 30 feet add +2 to attack rolls.
	2.	Wolf Lieutenant:
	‚Ä¢	HP: 100 | AC: 14
	‚Ä¢	Knockdown Swipe: Strength Save (DC 14) or be knocked prone.
	‚Ä¢	Howl of Fury (Recharge 5-6): Wolves gain advantage on attacks for 1 round.
	3.	Reinforcements:
	‚Ä¢	Wolves and crows join the fight in waves, forcing the adventurers to deal with constant pressure.
