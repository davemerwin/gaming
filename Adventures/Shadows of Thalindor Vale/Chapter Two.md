Chapter Two: The Bridge Across the River

Overview

The adventurers follow the wolves and crows‚Äô trail through the eastern forest to a ruined stone bridge, the only viable crossing into the deeper forest. The bridge, a relic of ancient dwarven craftsmanship, has partially collapsed, creating a treacherous gap over the roaring river below. Guarded by wolves, crows, and opportunistic trolls, the bridge is a dangerous chokepoint.

The adventurers must find a way to cross, outwit or defeat the defenders, and survive the hazards of the crumbling structure.

Approaching the Bridge

The trail ends at the edge of the forest, where the river cuts through a steep gorge.

Read-Aloud Text:

	The sound of rushing water fills the air as you break through the tree line. Before you, a great stone bridge spans the river, its once-proud arches cracked and crumbling. Wolves prowl the far side, their golden eyes watching for prey, while crows circle above, their cries echoing over the gorge. Two hulking figures‚Äîthe unmistakable shapes of mountain trolls‚Äîlurk beneath the bridge, their guttural laughter barely audible over the roar of the river.

Observing the Scene:
	‚Ä¢	A Perception Check (DC 14) reveals the patrol routes of the wolves and crows.
	‚Ä¢	A Nature or Arcana Check (DC 12) notes that the trolls are not allied with the wolves and crows but attack anything trying to cross.
	‚Ä¢	A History Check (DC 10) uncovers the bridge‚Äôs origins: dwarves built it centuries ago to connect their kingdom with the Vale.

Crossing the Bridge

The adventurers must decide how to approach the crossing.
	1.	Stealth Approach:
	‚Ä¢	Sneaking past the wolves and crows requires Stealth Checks (DC 15) for the party.
	‚Ä¢	Failure alerts the guards, initiating a skirmish at a disadvantageous position (surrounded on the narrow bridge).
	2.	Diversion:
	‚Ä¢	Creating a distraction (e.g., luring the trolls to attack the wolves or using an illusion spell) can clear part of the bridge.
	‚Ä¢	A successful Deception or Persuasion Check (DC 14) convinces the trolls to emerge and fight.
	3.	Direct Combat:
	‚Ä¢	A frontal assault pits the adventurers against the full complement of guards and risks drawing the trolls into the fray.

Enemies and Environmental Challenges

Bridge Defenders:
	‚Ä¢	Wolves (3): Agile fighters using pack tactics to knock adventurers prone and push them toward the edges of the bridge.
	‚Ä¢	Crows (2): Divebomb attackers, using their aerial mobility to harry spellcasters and archers.
	‚Ä¢	Crow Lieutenant (1): A shapeshifter capable of using spells like Entangle and Gust of Wind to disrupt the party‚Äôs movements.

Mountain Trolls (2):
	‚Ä¢	Trolls attack anyone who gets too close, swiping with massive claws and attempting to knock creatures off the bridge into the river below.
	‚Ä¢	The trolls are neutral toward the wolves and crows but are easily provoked.

Bridge Hazards:
	‚Ä¢	Crumbling Sections:
	‚Ä¢	Certain areas of the bridge are unstable. Stepping on them triggers a Dexterity Save (DC 13) to avoid falling into the river (taking 3d6 bludgeoning damage and entering the strong current).
	‚Ä¢	Wolves instinctively avoid these spots, but crows use them to lure adventurers into danger.
	‚Ä¢	Strong Winds:
	‚Ä¢	Gusts of wind make ranged attacks more difficult, imposing disadvantage unless the attacker is braced or using magic.

Victory Conditions

Once the adventurers eliminate the defenders or find a way across the bridge, they can investigate the area for clues about their next objective.
	1.	The Wolves‚Äô Map:
	‚Ä¢	Among the crow lieutenant‚Äôs belongings, the adventurers find a crude map marking the location of the Twilight Spire, deep in the Heartwood.
	‚Ä¢	A successful Investigation Check (DC 14) reveals that the Spire is the center of the wolves and crows‚Äô operations.
	2.	Trolls‚Äô Hoard (Optional):
	‚Ä¢	If the adventurers defeat the trolls, they can search beneath the bridge to find a hidden stash of treasures, including:
	‚Ä¢	150 GP
	‚Ä¢	Potion of Fire Breath
	‚Ä¢	A broken piece of a Dwarven Keystone (a hint at Karak Rhun‚Äôs importance in the final chapter).
	3.	The Fox Lord‚Äôs Vision:
	‚Ä¢	If the Fox Lord is traveling with the party, he shares a cryptic warning about the Twilight Spire:
	‚ÄúThis is no simple lair‚Äîit‚Äôs a wound in the forest. Be swift, be sharp, or it will swallow you whole.‚Äù

Transition to Chapter Three: The Twilight Spire

With the wolves and crows‚Äô trail uncovered, the adventurers press on into the Heartwood. The forest grows darker and more oppressive as they approach the Twilight Spire, where the Fox Lord is held captive.

Foreshadowing:
As the party travels deeper into the forest, they notice:
	‚Ä¢	Enchanted Wildlife: Animals with unnatural intelligence watch from the shadows, avoiding confrontation but clearly under the wolves and crows‚Äô influence.
	‚Ä¢	Signs of Torture: Shattered branches and claw marks on trees suggest a brutal effort to dominate the forest‚Äôs creatures.

Chapter Two Recap: Key Mechanics and Details

	1.	Challenges:
	‚Ä¢	Navigating the bridge‚Äôs hazards.
	‚Ä¢	Tactical combat involving wolves, crows, and trolls.
	2.	Dynamic Choices:
	‚Ä¢	Stealth and diversions can bypass or manipulate foes.
	‚Ä¢	Direct confrontation offers greater risks and rewards.
	3.	Clues for Chapter Three:
	‚Ä¢	The Twilight Spire is revealed as the wolves and crows‚Äô stronghold.
	‚Ä¢	Potential loot from trolls hints at the dwarves‚Äô greater role in the final chapter.
