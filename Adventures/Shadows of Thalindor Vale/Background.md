Adventure Module: Shadows of Thalindor Vale

Introduction

The Setting

Thalindor Vale, once a lush and peaceful region in the shadow of the dwarven kingdom of Karak Rhun, bears deep scars from the Dark War. Two years ago, the shadow wizard Kaevorr the Ashen drove his undead army through the Vale, shattering alliances and sowing devastation. Though Kaevorr was defeated, his influence lingers in the Vale‚Äôs fractured alliances, abandoned strongholds, and untamed magic.

At the heart of this strife lies a new threat: the wolves and crows, survivors of Kaevorr‚Äôs dominion, who have tasted power and now seek to claim the Vale as their kingdom. Their cunning leader, the Crow Shapeshifter Commander, rallies their forces, corrupting the forest‚Äôs balance and pushing toward Karak Rhun to seize its ancient forge.

The adventurers arrive in the Vale at a moment of crisis. The wolves and crows are consolidating power, the dwarves are struggling to defend their mountain, and the forest creatures are leaderless, divided, and fearful. It falls to the adventurers to bring unity to the land‚Äîor see it fall into ruin.
